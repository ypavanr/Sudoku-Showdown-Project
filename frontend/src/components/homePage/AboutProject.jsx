          <h2><u><b>Motivation</b></u></h2>
        </div>
        <p>What began as a friendly competition among us quickly turned into a full-fledged project. We used to challenge each other to solve Sudoku puzzles faster, but we couldn’t find any good applications that let us compete on the same puzzle in real-time. Most apps focused only on solo play, and none offered the multiplayer experience we were looking for.
So, we decided to build our own.
At first, our focus was on competition—racing to finish the same puzzle faster than our friends. But as we started developing, we realized that solving puzzles together was just as fun. That led us to implement a cooperative mode, where multiple players could work together on the same Sudoku grid.
As the project grew, we kept adding more user-friendly features and better interfaces to make the experience more engaging. Sudoku Savvy evolved from just a personal challenge into a polished multiplayer Sudoku platform—designed to bring people together, whether they want to compete, collaborate, or just have fun solving puzzles.</p>

    <li><b>Expert Level (66 empty cells)</b> – The ultimate challenge! Unlike other levels, puzzles here can have multiple solutions and disable validation and scoring for added intensity.</li>
    <li><b>Difficulty Levels</b> – Choose from Easy (35 empty cells), Medium (45), Hard (55), or Expert (66) based on your skill and mood.</li>
    <li><b>Custom Puzzle Generator</b> – Automatically generates puzzles with unique solutions for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels.</li>
    <li><b>Expert Mode Generator</b> – Creates very challenging puzzles that can have multiple valid solutions.</li>
    <li><b>Solution Verifier</b> – Ensures generated puzzles have a unique solution in all levels except Expert.</li>
    <li><b>Room Creation</b> – Players can create multiple rooms, each with its own settings and game mode.</li>
    <li><b>One Room per Player</b> – Each user can only join one room at a time to keep gameplay consistent.</li>
    <li><b>Host Privileges</b> – The host chooses the level, mode, and time before starting the game.</li>
    <li><b>Host Transfer</b> – If the host leaves, another player automatically becomes the new host.</li>
    <li><b>Validation System</b> – Automatically checks inputs for correctness in all levels except Expert.</li>
    <li><b>Real-Time Chat</b> – Communicate with other players while you play—strategize, trash talk, or just vibe.</li>
    <li><b>Quit Button</b> – Lets you leave the room or game at any time with a single click.</li>
    <li><b>New Game Trigger</b> – Hosts can launch a new game round directly from the room settings.</li>
    <li><b>Leaderboard (Competitive Mode)</b> – Tracks and displays player rankings based on speed and accuracy.</li>
    <li><b>Point System</b> – Awards points in competitive mode based on how quickly and accurately players complete the puzzle (not available in Expert mode).</li>

          <h2><u><b>What We Learnt</b></u></h2>
        </div>
        <p>Through building this project, we gained valuable experience with Socket.IO and real-time communication. We learned how to create and manage rooms, handle events between clients and the server, and implement a lot of features. This gave us a deeper understanding of WebSockets and how real-time multiplayer systems work behind the scenes.<br></br>
We also significantly improved our skills in frontend design and user experience. From developing responsive layouts to adding smooth transitions and intuitive controls, we focused on making the interface both attractive and user-friendly. Styling the platform to support different game modes and adapting layouts for multiplayer interaction challenged us to think about design from the user's perspective.<br></br>
Another major learning area was Sudoku puzzle generation and validation. We built a custom algorithm that could generate puzzles of varying difficulty levels, ensuring unique solutions for Easy to Hard modes, while allowing multi-solution flexibility in Expert mode. Implementing input validation and dynamically updating the grid further enhanced our understanding of game logic and UI integration.<br></br>
Finally, we learned how an actual real-time game flow works—from game setup and starting sequences to handling restarts, host transitions, and edge cases like player disconnection. Working through these systems gave us insight into how robust multiplayer games are structured and the kinds of challenges that come with building them.
